As a part of the Senior Mechanical Engineering Final Project, we were responsible for developing a hunter drone platform that is able to track down malicious drones, and neutralize the threat by shooting a net-gun. This project was sponsored by Meteksan SAVUNMA. 

In this repo, you can find the python codes for:

1) pixel-image tracking of an object selected by the user by selecting a bounding box while capturing a live-video.
2) a feature-tracking code where an image of an object is given, and that object's features and tracked while capturing a live-video. 
3) A final version that utlizes (1) the pixel-image tracking code and controls the movement of the ServoMotors with respect to the tracked object. The servos are built into a gimbal-mechanism where a net-gun is mounted, ready to be fired upon user command. 

The main library used was OpenCV with Python...
